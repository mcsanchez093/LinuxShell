# LinuxShell
Custom Linux/UNIX shell with re-creations of basic executables (cp, ls, groups, cd)

Compile all executables in the same directory and run the shell executable.

ls supports -a and -l flags

All other built-in executables can also be called with the shell, as long as they can be found with the "which" command.

Known Bugs:
-ls -l command may display incorrect date
-occasional zombie processes or crashes

These programs were written for my Linux/UNIX programming class under time constraints and therefore have not been perfected.
