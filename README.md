# LinuxShell
Custom Linux/UNIX shell with re-creations of basic executables (cp, ls, groups, cd)

Compile all executables in the same directory and run the shell executable.

cp: supports -r flag
ls: supports -a and -l flags

All other built-in executables can also be called with the shell, as long as they can be found with the "which" command.
